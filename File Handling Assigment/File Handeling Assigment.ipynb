    "3.Append mode (\"a\"): In this mode, the file is opened for appending new data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it is created.<br>\n",
    "4.Binary mode (\"b\"): This mode is used for opening a file in binary mode. In this mode, the file is read or written in its binary format.<br>\n",
    "5.Text mode (\"t\"): This mode is used for opening a file in text mode. In this mode, the file is read or written in its text format.<br>\n",

    "Ans. The close() function is used to close a file after it has been opened in a Python program. It is important to close a file because it releases any system resources being used by the file, such as memory and open file descriptors, which can otherwise cause issues with other programs\n",

If a file is not properly closed after it has been used, these resources will continue to be allocated to the file, even if the program that opened the file has finished executing. This can cause memory leaks, which can slow down the computer and cause other programs to crash.\n",
